# Markov Model for Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the Markov Model for Stock Price Prediction project! This project aims to implement a Markov model to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Overview
The Markov model is a stochastic process that assumes the future state of a system depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In this project, we leverage this concept to predict future stock prices based on historical price data.

## Features
- Implementation of a Markov model for stock price prediction.
- Utilization of historical stock price data to train and validate the model.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model and make predictions.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
5. Experiment with different parameters or preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Usage
- Train the model using historical stock price data.
- Make predictions for future stock prices based on the trained model.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions using metrics such as mean squared error or mean absolute error.
